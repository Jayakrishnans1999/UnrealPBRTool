üöÄ Bridging the Gap: New PBR Texture Tool for ArchViz Artists
Just wrapped up creating a specialized tool that's close to my heart - a PBR Texture Processor designed specifically for architectural visualization artists who might not be familiar with complex workflows like Substance Designer or Mari.
What it does: ‚úÖ Pack individual texture maps (Albedo, AO, Roughness, Metallic, Normal) into optimized formats for Unreal Engine ‚úÖ Split packed textures back into individual maps when needed ‚úÖ Generate normal maps from height maps automatically
 ‚úÖ Export ready-to-use ORM (Occlusion-Roughness-Metallic) packed textures ‚úÖ Handle multiple formats and resolutions with drag-and-drop simplicity
Why this matters: Many talented ArchViz artists create stunning visuals but get bogged down by technical texture workflows. This tool eliminates the need to learn complex software just to get your textures Unreal-ready. Whether you're packing maps for optimization or separating packed textures for different engines, it's all handled with a simple GUI.
I'm always looking for ways to bridge the gap between creative and technical teams. When artists can focus on their craft instead of wrestling with technical barriers, everyone wins. The creative vision flows seamlessly into the technical pipeline.
Available as a standalone executable - no Python installation required. Sometimes the best tools are the ones that just work. üõ†Ô∏è
Make a folder named "UnrealPBRTool" in C drive. Download this Script and save as python unreal_pbr_tool_full.py in the "UnrealPBRTool" folder.
Install Python and supporting libraries.
Run this code in Python " cd C:\UnrealPBRTool "
python unreal_pbr_tool_full.py

To make an Exe:  
Run this Code in python " pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole unreal_pbr_tool_full.py "


Copy the "unreal_pbr_tool_full.exe" file from "dist" folder and paste it in your desktop. Don't Rename/Remove the "UnrealPBRTool" folder files.

Thankyou, Stay creative....
